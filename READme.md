#AWS Lambda Story Generator with Jurassic-2 Ultra and S3 Integration
This project demonstrates the use of AWS Lambda to generate stories using the Jurassic-2 Ultra model via AWS Bedrock and store the results in an S3 bucket. The function is designed with modular components, robust error handling, and a configurable setup for various use cases.

Overview
The Lambda function consists of three main components:

1. Story Generator
Leverages the Jurassic-2 Ultra model (ai21.j2-ultra-v1) to generate stories based on a given topic.
Includes timeout management using context.get_remaining_time_in_millis() to avoid incomplete processing.
2. Save to S3
Saves the generated story as a .txt file in a specified S3 bucket.
Implements error handling to gracefully manage S3 upload failures.
3. Lambda Handler
Processes the input event, invokes the story generator, and stores the result in S3.
Key Configuration Parameters
Jurassic-2 Ultra Model ID: ai21.j2-ultra-v1
Lambda Timeout: Default is 300 seconds (can be adjusted in Lambda settings).
S3 Bucket: Ensure the bucket name matches the environment variable in the Lambda configuration.
Troubleshooting
Common Issues and Resolutions
Timeout Errors:
Increase the Lambda timeout in the function settings.
Decrease the maxTokens parameter in the model request for shorter responses.
Access Denied Errors:
Ensure the Lambda execution role has permissions for AWS Bedrock and S3.
Invalid Model ID:
Verify the correct model ID: ai21.j2-ultra-v1.
S3 Upload Failures:
Check the S3 bucket policy.
Ensure the Lambda execution role includes s3:PutObject permissions.
Future Enhancements
Additional Model Support: Integrate other AWS Bedrock models, such as Claude or GPT-based models.
Workflow Orchestration: Implement AWS Step Functions to handle longer workflows.
API Gateway Integration: Add API Gateway for external access to the Lambda function.
